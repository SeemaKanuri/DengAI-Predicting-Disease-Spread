1.	I started doing in Python, and has done some preliminary visulization. I have shared the output in html format where I have ploted and Exploratory Data Analysis. Name of the Script: Model_1_DengAI_2017.ipynb

2.	Secondly, coming to exploring the data in python was little tedius for me it took nearly a day just to install few packages and I spend vertually a long time on setting the framework for the required packages. I have used python and R both , in which for 1 model I used python and other 2 models I have used R.

3.	However R seems to be an easy choice where I was able to do the analysis in a quick time. I have used 2 models:

4 . This folder contains 4 scripts of four different  Models .
	Model-1 Generalized Linear Models( best accuracy model) score 25.6010
	Model-2 Negative binomial regression Score 25.9976
	Model-3 Neural Networks & Forecasting 26.2933

5.  Each model has Output predicted value file and Rmarkdown file for preview.
